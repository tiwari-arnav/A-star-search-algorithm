# A-star-search-algorithm
This is an A star search algorithm with graph search implemented to plan a robots path


## Problem description
The inputs to your program are the start and goal positions of a point robot, and a 2D integer array that represents the robot workspace. The robot can move from cell to cell in any of the eight directions. The goal is to find the lowest-cost path between the start position and the goal position, and avoiding obstacles along the path. The workspace is represented as an occupancy grid, where the black cells represent obstacles.
